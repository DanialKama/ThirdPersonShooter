# Third-Person Shooter
## Introduction
This project is a third-person shooter (single-player) sample project developed in Unreal Engine 5.
This is not production-ready code but a starting point for learning and developing TPS concepts.

## Concepts covered
- Pickup system for weapons and ammo
- Enemy and friend AI (based on Gameplay Tags) with sight, damage, hearing and prediction senses, and abilities like a point to point patrolling, combat (aim, fire weapon, reload and switch to another weapon), navigating to important places, search, retreat (on low health), take cover, and healing.
- Health component (reducing health based on damage type and health recovery based on stamina level)
- Stamina component (reducing stamina based on movement states and stamina recovery)
- Ammo component
- All weapon-related activities implemented (switch, reload, and drop with animations and sound)
- Weapon, projectile, magazine, empty shell actors
- Weapon recoil (player camera shake, AI aim offset, and character animation) and bullet spread
- Advanced animation setups for every weapon type and every movement state and moving direction (2D blend space and aim offsets)
- Chaos Destruction and Field Systems (plugin is in beta and not stable)
- Body dismemberment based on hit bone
- fall damage with getup animation based on mesh orientation
- AI respawn system
- Level Manager and Interactable actors (like the automatic door)
- Improved level Streaming blueprints (load or unload levels based on doors state)
