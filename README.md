# Third-Person Shooter

## Introduction
This is a third-person shooter (single-player) sample project developed in Unreal Engine.  
This is not production-ready code but a starting point for learning and developing TPS concepts.

## Features
- Enemy and friend AI (based on Gameplay Tags) with sight, damage, hearing, and prediction senses, and abilities like a point to point patrolling, combat (aim, fire weapon, reload and switch to another weapon), navigating to important places, search, retreat (on low health), take cover, and healing.
- Health and stamina components
- All weapon-related activities implemented (switch, reload, and drop)
- Weapon recoil (player camera shake, AI aim offset, and animations) and bullet spread
- Body dismemberment based on hit bone
